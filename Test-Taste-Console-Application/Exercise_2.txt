* Problems with the Current Solution
	It takes a long time to run because it does everything step by step.
	It recalculates the average moon gravity every time it's accessed, which is slow.

* Advantages of the New Solution
	It is faster because tasks can run at the same time.
	It reduces unnecessary calculations by reusing the stored average moon gravity value.
